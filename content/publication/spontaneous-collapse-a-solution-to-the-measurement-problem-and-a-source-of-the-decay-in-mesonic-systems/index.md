abstract: "Dynamical reduction models propose a solution to the measurement
  problem in quantum mechanics: the collapse of the wave function becomes a
  physical process. We compute the predictions to decaying and
  flavor-oscillating neutral mesons for the two most promising collapse models,
  the QMUPL (quantum mechanics with universal position localization) model and
  the mass-proportional CSL (continuous spontaneous localization) model. Our
  results are showing (i) a strong sensitivity to the very assumptions of the
  noise field underlying those two collapse models and (ii) under particular
  assumptions the CSL case allows one even to recover the decay dynamics. This
  in turn allows one to predict the effective collapse rates solely based on the
  measured values for the oscillation (mass differences) and the measured values
  of the decay constants. The four types of neutral mesons (K meson, D meson, Bd
  meson, and Bs meson) lead surprisingly to ranges comparable to those put
  forward by Adler [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 2935 (2007)] and Ghirardi,
  Rimini, and Weber [Phys. Rev. D 34, 470 (1986)]. Our results show that these
  systems at high energies are very sensitive to possible modifications of the
  standard quantum theory, making them a very powerful laboratory to rule out
  certain collapse scenarios and study the detailed physical processes solving
  the measurement problem."
