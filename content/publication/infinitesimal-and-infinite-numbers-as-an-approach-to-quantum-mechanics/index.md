abstract: Non-Archimedean mathematics is an approach based on fields which
  contain infinitesimal and infinite elements. Within this approach, we
  construct a space of a particular class of generalized functions,
  ultrafunctions. The space of ultrafunctions can be used as a richer framework
  for a description of a physical system in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we
  provide a discussion of the space of ultrafunctions and its advantages in the
  applications of quantum mechanics, particularly for the Schr√∂dinger equation
  for a Hamiltonian with the delta function potential.
