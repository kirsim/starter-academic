abstract: "We study the probability oscillations of mixed particles in the
  presence of self-gravitational interaction. We show a breaking of the
  CPT-symmetry due to the contemporary violation of the T-symmetry and the
  CP-symmetry preservation. This violation is directly associated to the rising
  of the entanglement among the elements of the system that can be seen as a
  pure many-body effect scaling with the number of the elements in the system.
  This effect could have played a relevant role in the first stages of the
  Universe or in core of very dense systems. Experiments based on Rydberg atoms
  confined in microtraps can simulate the mixing and the mutual interaction and
  could allow to test the mechanism here presented. "
