abstract: "The dynamics of a quantum system with internal degrees of freedom
  undergoing spontaneous collapse in the position basis are analysed; e.g.,
  neutral mesons or neutrinos. Surprisingly, the value of the Heaviside function
  Î¸(x) at x=0 that can in general be chosen in the interval [0,1] leads to
  different physical predictions. For the QMUPL (Quantum Mechanics with
  Universal Position Localization) model only a single value leads to
  probabilities conserving the particle number. Herewith the physical properties
  of the noise field can be constrained. This opens a road to study the physical
  properties of the noise field essential for collapse models. "
