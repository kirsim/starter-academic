abstract: Why do we never see a table in a superposition of here and there? This
  problem gets a solution by so called collapse models assuming the collapse as
  a genuinely physical process. Here we consider two specific collapse models
  and apply them to systems at high energies, i.e. flavour oscillating neutral
  meson systems. We find on one hand a potentially new interpretation of the
  decay rates introduced by hand in the standard formalism and on the other hand
  that these systems at high energies constrain by experimental data the
  possible collapse scenarios.
