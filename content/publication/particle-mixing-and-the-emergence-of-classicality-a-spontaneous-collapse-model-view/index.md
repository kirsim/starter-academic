abstract: "Spontaneous collapse models aim to resolve the measurement problem in
  quantum mechanics by considering wave-function collapse as a physical process.
  We analyze how these models affect a decaying flavor-oscillating system whose
  evolution is governed by a phenomenological non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In
  turn, we apply two popular collapse models, the Quantum Mechanics with
  Universal Position Localization and the Continuous Spontaneous Localization
  models, to a neutral meson system. By using the equivalence between the
  approaches to the time evolution of decaying systems with a non-Hermitian
  Hamiltonian and a dissipator of the Lindblad form in an enlarged Hilbert
  space, we show that spontaneous collapse can induce the decay dynamics in both
  quantum state and master equations. Moreover, we show that the decay property
  of a flavor-oscillating system is intimately connected to the time (a)symmetry
  of the noise field underlying the collapse mechanism. This (a)symmetry, in
  turn, is related to the definition of the stochastic integral and can provide
  a physical intuition behind the It≈ç-Stratonovich dilemma in stochastic
  calculus. "
