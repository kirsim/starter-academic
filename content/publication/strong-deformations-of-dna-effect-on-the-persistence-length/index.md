abstract: Extreme deformations of the DNA double helix attracted a lot of
  attention during the past decades. Particularly, the determination of the
  persistence length of DNA with extreme local disruptions, or kinks, has become
  a crucial problem in the studies of many important biological processes. In
  this paper we review an approach to calculate the persistence length of the
  double helix by taking into account the formation of kinks of arbitrary
  configuration. The reviewed approach improves the Kratky-Porod model to
  determine the type and nature of kinks that occur in the double helix, by
  measuring a reduction of the persistence length of the kinkable DNA.
