abstract: We characterize the impact that the application of two consecutive
  quantum channels or their quantum superposition (thus, without a definite
  causal order) has on ergotropy, i.e. the maximum work that can be extracted
  from a system through a cyclic unitary transformation. First of all, we show
  that commutative channels always lead to a non-negative gain; non-commutative
  channels, on the other hand, can entail both an increase and a decrease in
  ergotropy. We then perform a thorough analysis for qubit channels and provide
  general conditions for achieving a positive gain on the incoherent part of
  ergotropy. Finally, we extend our results to d-dimensional quantum systems
  undergoing a pair of completely depolarizing channels.
