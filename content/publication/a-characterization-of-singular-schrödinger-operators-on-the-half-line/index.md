abstract: We study a class of delta-like perturbations of the Laplacian on the
  half-line, characterized by Robin boundary conditions at the origin. Using the
  formalism of nonstandard analysis, we derive a simple connection with a
  suitable family of Schrödinger operators with potentials of very large
  (infinite) magnitude and very short (infinitesimal) range. As a consequence,
  we also derive a similar result for point interactions in the Euclidean space
  R³, in the case of radial potentials. Moreover, we discuss explicitly our
  results in the case of potentials that are linear in a neighbourhood of the
  origin.
