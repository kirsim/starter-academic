abstract: Frustration of classical many-body systems can be used to distinguish
  ferromagnetic interactions from anti-ferromagnetic ones via the Toulouse
  conditions. A quantum version of the Toulouse conditions provides a similar
  classification based on the local ground states. We compute the global ground
  states for a family of models with Heisenberg-like interactions and analyse
  their behaviour with respect to frustration, entanglement and degeneracy. For
  that we develop analytical and numerical analysing tools capable of
  quantifying the interplay between those three quantities. We find that the
  quantum Toulouse conditions provide a proper classification, however,
  refinements can be found. Our results show how the different local ground
  states affect the interplay and pave the way for further generalisation and
  possible applications to other quantum many-body systems.
