I am postdoctoral researcher currently working on [quantum foundations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foundations) and tools from [nonstandard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis) to find a consistent [mathematical framework of quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics).

I was awarded my PhD in June 2018 from University of Vienna with the thesis “Analysis of Spontaneous Collapse in a Neutral Meson System” focused on the intersection of quantum foundations ([measurement problem,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem) [spontaneous collapse models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-collapse_theory)) and high energy physics ([mixed particle systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_particle_oscillation)). Before my graduate studies at UV, I received degrees in physics at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv with concentration in theoretical biological physics ([statistical mechanics of DNA](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781563960710)).
