abstract: Non-Archimedean mathematics, in particular, nonstandard analysis is an
  approach based on fields that contain infinitesimal and infinite elements.
  Within this approach, we construct a space of a particular class of
  generalized functions, ultrafunctions. The space of ultrafunctions can be used
  as a richer framework for a description of a physical system in quantum
  mechanics. In this talk, I provide a discussion on nonstandard analysis and
  the space of ultrafunctions and their advantages in the applications of
  quantum mechanics, particularly, for the Schr√∂dinger equation for a
  Hamiltonian with the Dirac delta potential.
